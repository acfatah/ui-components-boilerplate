# Badges

Badges are typically used to display a small piece of information, such as a count or status indicator. They are often used to:

- **Show notifications**: Indicating the number of unread messages or notifications.
- **Status indicators**: Showing the status of an item (e.g., online/offline).
- **Highlighting**: Drawing attention to new or important items.
