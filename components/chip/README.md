# Chips

Chips are small, interactive elements that represent an input, attribute, or action. They often contain text, an icon, or both, and can be used for various purposes such as:

- **Filtering**: Allowing users to filter content (e.g., product categories).
- **Selection**: Representing selected items (e.g., selected tags).
- **Actions**: Triggering actions (e.g., adding an item to a list).
